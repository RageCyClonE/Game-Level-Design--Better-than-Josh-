Thank you for purchasing my sandstone rocks pack. It includes 10 models of sandstone rocks and boulders of various sizes. 

Each of the rocks features a normal map. Each of the larger rocks features a diffuse map with ambient occlusion baked in. The smaller rocks feature a plain and tileable version of the texture. If you would like to reduce the texture count of these rocks, you can use the tileable version of the texture named "T_SandstoneRock_diffuse.png".

In the "Source" folder, you can find the source .blend file for the models, the AO maps, and the PSD file for all the diffuse textures. This PSD includes all the AO maps as well.

Thanks again!
